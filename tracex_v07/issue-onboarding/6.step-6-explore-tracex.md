By now, you’ve learned how to create and manage controlled documents in TraceX.  
But TraceX does much more than document control — it’s a comprehensive platform designed to support your entire product lifecycle in regulated industries.

---

🧠 **Built on top of Huly**

TraceX is built on the Huly open-source platform. While Huly is used by IT and product teams for flexible project collaboration, TraceX extends it with the compliance and quality modules required by regulated sectors like healthcare, medtech, biotech, and automotive.
