Listen to and evaluate the current sound effect assigned to sword swings and hits. 

Assess how well the audio matches the weapon’s design, weight, and impact. Consider the timing, variation, and emotional tone—does it feel satisfying, powerful, and responsive? Take note of any inconsistencies or areas for improvement, such as missing layers (e.g., whoosh, impact, metal ring) or lack of variation. 

Provide detailed feedback for revisions or approve it if it meets the desired quality and feel. Reference any similar game sounds for comparison if helpful.
