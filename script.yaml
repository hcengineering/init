          A **Todo** is a task to be completed by a specific team member. 

          > *But wait … didn’t we just create an **Issue** assigned to a team member?* What’s the difference? 

          At a glance:

          * **Issue** - work that needs to be completed 
          * **Todo** - an individual’s responsibility to complete that work

          When an Issue is created with the status of “Todo” and assigned to a team member, that team member receives a corresponding Todo item in their personal Planner.

          Let’s see how an Issue status is *automatically updated* based on an individual team member’s progress towards their Todo. Let’s go!

          ---

          ### Task 4 - Schedule your first Todo

          Remember that Issue you just created in the previous step? Because you set the Issue status to “Todo” and assigned it to yourself, you’ve received a corresponding Todo for that Issue.

          Head over to your Planner by clicking the calendar icon in the left sidebar. Here, you’ll see a Todo for the Issue you just created!

          There are 2 ways to schedule a Todo:

          * Click and drag the Todo to your calendar on the right side panel, *or*
          * Click on the Todo ****to open it in the right side panel. Click `Add Slot` to create a time slot representing when you plan to do the work. From there, you can adjust the day and time and add more slots if needed.

          Notice that when you schedule a Todo, it moves from “Unplanned” to “Scheduled” on the list.

          Now, navigate back to the Tracker by clicking the checkbox icon in the left side panel. Notice that the status *automatically updated* to “In Progress”! That’s because you scheduled your Todo, indicating your commitment to completing the work.

          If you’d like, go ahead back to your Planner and check off your Todo by clicking the round checkbox that appears when you hover over it. You’ll see that the Issue status automatically updates to “Done”.
