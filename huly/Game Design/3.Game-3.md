Conceptualize a unique signature weapon for the main character that reflects their personality, backstory, and combat style. 

Describe the weapon’s appearance in detail—materials, shape, visual motifs—and outline any special abilities or effects it has in gameplay. Think about how the weapon evolves (if it upgrades or changes) and what role it plays in the world’s lore. 

The weapon should feel iconic and memorable, serving both as a gameplay tool and a storytelling device. Include inspiration references and ideas for animation or audio where relevant.
