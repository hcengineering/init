title: Documents or Cards?
---

If you’ve already completed our [onboarding tasks](../Welcome%20to%20Huly/1.Welcome.md)), you’ve probably had a chance to explore **Cards**.

Cards are a flexible framework for structuring information efficiently. You can create databases based on any kind of information you need to store. You can use Cards to completely replace Documents in your workspace — or use them both simultaneously for different purposes.

Let’s take a look at the key similarities and differences between **Documents** and **Cards**:

### Similarities

- Content is created with the same text editor  
- Activity section records change history and includes area for commenting
- Set roles, permissions and privacy at the space level


### Differences between Documents and Cards

| Feature | Documents | Cards |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Attributes** | Attributes are defined by the system such as title, content, created by, etc. | Attributes are defined by you, and you can set as many as you want |
| **Sorting and filtering** | Cannot be sorted/filtered by attributes | Can be sorted/filtered by attributes |
| **Attachments** | No designated area for attachments — can only send attachments in the Activity section | Designated area for attachments |
| **Organizational structure** | Nested, where documents can be nested within other documents | Organized by Type, where Cards of the same Type are grouped together |
| **Relations** | Can be linked together in a 1:1 relation through @ mentions and backlinks | Can be linked through parent-child relations, and using References and Relations defined on their Type |


> **Note**: While our initial implementation of Cards is focused on knowledge management, Cards will also serve as the foundation for many other features on the platform, including process management and threads. With Cards, you'll be able to build your own custom applications within Huly, such as a CRM, CMS, project management system and more. Stay tuned for more updates soon!

### Okay, that was a lot of information … so which should I choose? 🥴 Let’s keep it simple!

#### Use Cards if:

- You need to add some attributes to your docs, like “client”, “document type” or “status”  
- You need to be able to sort and filter your content by attributes  
- You need to define specific relations between types of entities; for example: `Contract ←→ Client`  
- You plan to build processes and workflows around your Cards in the future  

#### Use Documents if:

- Your docs organization is simple, where the nested document structure is sufficient  
- You need to jot down some quick notes, without needing to store them in a structured format

Of course, the best way to find out which system is right for you is to try them both and see what works. **Happy exploring! 🚀**
