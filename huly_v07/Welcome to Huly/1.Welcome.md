### **Welcome to Huly, your all-in-one project management platform!** 

Embark on an exciting journey to learn the essential tools available to you on the Huly Platform! Huly includes powerful features for collaborative editing, knowledge management, video conferencing and more.

As you explore your workspace, you’ll find **game characters**, **narrative documents** and **game assets**. We’ll get you started with a basic game design system that you can expand upon yourself — or simply use as a reference for how you can collaborate with your team on Huly!

Here’s a sneak peek 👀
