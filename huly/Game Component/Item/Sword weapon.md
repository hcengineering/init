The **Sword weapon** is a melee item that allows the player to engage enemies at close range. It is the hero's default weapon, ideal for fast-paced, direct combat. The sword delivers swift strikes and can be used to chain basic attacks or execute combos, depending on the game's mechanics. While it lacks the range of other weapons, it offers reliability and quick recovery between swings.
