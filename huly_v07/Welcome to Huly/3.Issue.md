An **issue** represents a specific task that needs to be completed. Projects can contain many issues and sub-issues.

### Task 3 - Assign yourself an issue

**_Assigning an existing issue:_**

Now it’s time to assign yourself an issue in your `GAME DESIGN` project! Follow these steps:

1. First, navigate back to the `GAME DESIGN` project in the left side panel and select `Issues`.
2. Click to open any issue that interests you.
3. In the right side panel, open `Assignee` and select **yourself**.
4. Set the issue `Status` to **Todo**. ❗This is important for the next step!

**_Creating a new issue (optional alternative)_**

Instead of assigning an existing issue to yourself, you can also create a new issue!

1. Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the top of the side panel (or press `C` from any view).
2. Enter some information about your issue, such as a title and description.
3. Set the `Assignee` to **yourself**. 
4. Set the `Status` to **Todo**. ❗This is important for the next step!
5. Click `Create issue`.
