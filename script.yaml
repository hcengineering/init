          An **Issue** represents a specific task that needs to be completed. Projects can be broken down into Issues. 

          ### Task 3 - Create your first Issue

          Let’s create your first Issue in Huly!

          Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the stop of the side panel (or simply press `C` from any view!). This will open a dialog where you can enter some initial settings for your Issue. 

          > **Tip:** By default, the Issue will be associated with the Project you’re viewing. You can change this to the Project you just created by selecting it from the dropdown in the top left corner.

          Next, enter some information about your Issue: 

          * Provide a **title** and **description**. 
          * Choose some settings, such as **priority**, **labels**, **estimation** and **due date**. 
          * The **assignee** will be the default assignee you selected for your project.
          * ❗ Ensure that the **status** is set to “Todo” — *this is important for the next step!*

          When you’re ready, click `Create issue`!

          🎉 Congratulations! You’ve completed Task 3 ✅  

          In the next step, you’ll learn how Huly has *automatically* created a Todo for this Issue, which you’ll schedule in your personal Planner. Click the button below to continue!

          **Projects** contain all the tasks your team will be working on, and they can be organized however you’d like. 

          For example, a software engineering team may choose to create Projects called “Frontend”, “Backend”, “UX/UI” and “Testing”. A small business may choose to create Projects like “Inventory”, “Marketing,” and “Design”.

          ### Task 2 - Create your first Project

          Let’s create your first Project in Huly!

          Make sure the Tracker sidebar is open on the left side - if you don’t see it, click the two horizontal lines  `=` to reveal it.

          There are two ways to create a Project:

          * Hover over **YOUR PROJECTS** and click the `+` icon that appears, *or*
          * Click the dropdown menu next to the `+ New issue` button and select `Create project`. 

          At a minimum, enter a **title** and **default assignee**. You can also add a **description**, choose a custom **identifier** and select an **icon** for your Project (you can read more about these settings in our [Huly Docs](https://docs.huly.io/getting-started/create-project/)). 

          Next, Click `Create`!
