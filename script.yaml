          An **Action Item** is a task to be completed by a specific team member. 

          > *But wait … didn’t we just create an **issue** assigned to a team member?* What’s the difference? 

          At a glance:

          * **Issue** - work that needs to be completed 
          * **Action Item** - an individual’s responsibility to complete that work

          When an issue is created with the status of “Todo” and assigned to a team member, that team member receives a corresponding Action Item in their personal Planner.

          Let’s see how the issue status is *automatically updated* based on an individual team member’s progress towards their Action Item. Let’s go!

          ---

          ### Task 4 - Schedule your first Action Item

          Remember that issue you just created in the previous step? Because you set the issue status to “Todo” and assigned it to yourself, you’ve received a corresponding Action Item for that issue.

          Head over to your Planner by clicking the calendar icon in the left sidebar. Here, you’ll see an Action Item for the issue you just created!

          There are 2 ways to schedule an Action Item:

          * Click and drag the Action Item to your calendar on the right, *or*
          * Click on the Action Item ****to open it in the right side panel. Click `Add Slot` to create a time slot representing when you plan to do the work. From there, you can adjust the day and time and add more slots if needed.

          Notice that when you schedule an Action Item, it moves from “Unplanned” to “Scheduled” on your list.

          Now, navigate back to the Tracker by clicking the checkbox icon in the left side panel. Notice that the status of your issue *automatically updated* to “In Progress”! That’s because you scheduled your Action Item, indicating your commitment to completing the work.

          ![](image://file?file=${gif4}&width=1440)

          If you’d like, go ahead back to your Planner and check off your Action Item by clicking the round checkbox that appears when you hover over it. You’ll see that the issue status automatically updates to “Done”.

          An **issue** represents a specific task that needs to be completed. Projects can be broken down into issues and sub-issues.

          ### Task 3 - Create your first issue

          Let’s create your first issue in Huly!

          Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the stop of the side panel (or simply press `C` from any view!). This will open a dialog where you can enter some initial settings for your issue. 

          > **Tip:** By default, the issue will be associated with the project you’re currently viewing. You can change this to the project you just created by selecting it from the dropdown in the top left corner.

          Next, enter some information about your issue: 

          * Provide a **title** and **description**. 
          * Choose some settings, such as **priority**, **labels**, **estimation** and **due date**. 
          * The **assignee** will be the default assignee you selected for your project.
          * ❗ Ensure that the **status** is set to “Todo” — *this is important for the next step!*

          When you’re ready, click `Create issue`!

          * Hover over **YOUR PROJECTS** and click the `+` icon that appears, *or*
          * Click the dropdown menu next to the `+ New issue` button and select `Create project`. 

          A **title** and **default assignee** are required. You can also add a **description**, choose a custom **identifier** and select an **icon** for your project. 

          Next, click `Create`!

          # **Creating a teamspace**

          Documents are organized into teamspaces, which can be used to model your team’s organizational structure. For example, you may choose to organize your documents into teamspaces called “Features”, “Marketing”, “Style Guides” etc.

          To create a teamspace, click the `+` that appears when hovering over the word “Teamspaces” in the sidebar, or by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the `+ Create a Document` button and selecting `Create teamspace`.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif1}&width=1440)

          # **Creating a document**

          There are two ways to create a document:

          Click the `+ Create a document` button at the top of the sidebar. This opens a dialog with the option to select a teamspace for your document; the default parent will be the most recently selected teamspace or document. Enter a title for your document and click `Create`.

          Alternatively, hover over the a teamspace name or any other document and click the `+` button that appears. The new document will automatically be nested within the teamspace or document you selected.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif2}&width=1440)

          # **Formatting document content**

          Documents support markdown formatting. There are a few ways to access formatting options for your text:

          Type markdown syntax directly into your document.

          Use the floating toolbar that appears when text is selected on the page.

          Formatting options include headers, text emphasis, links, blockquotes, numbered and bulleted lists, and code blocks.

          Images, tables and separator lines are also available by hovering over text and clicking the `+` icon that appears on the left side.

          # **Enrich your documents with @mentions, Action Items and live collaboration**

          Documents are directly integrated within the rest of the Huly platform, making it easy to tag team members, assign Action Items and link to issues. Team members can collaborate in real time, eliminating the need to send files back and forth or meet to discuss revisions.

          # **Mentions**

          Mention a team member by using @mention syntax. The member will receive a notification that they have been mentioned in the document. 

          # **Creating Action Items**

          Create an Action Item by typing `[]` then `space` on a new line. Alternatively, type `/` and select `Action Item` from the dropdown menu. An empty checkbox will appear, and as you begin typing, a profile icon will appear to the left of the checkbox. Click this icon to select a team member to assign the Action Item to. That team member will receive a notification that they have been assigned an Action Item, and they’ll be able to schedule the Action Item in their Planner.

          * [ ] You can assign an Action Item any time by hovering over the checkbox and clicking the profile icon. 
          * [ ] Try assigning these Action Items to yourself!

          # **Real-time collaboration**

          Team members can collaborate on documents at the same time! Multiple people can edit and add to documents simultaneously. Check out our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspdJ5TjFNQ) to learn more about collaborative editing in Huly documents!

          Huly’s **Team Planner** is a powerful tool that provides a bird's-eye view of your team's workflow, enhancing collaboration and efficiency. This is a dedicated space where you can see your team's scheduled activities and progress. 

          You can access your Team Planner any time by clicking the sun icon in the left sidebar. It won’t look like much until your team starts using Huly to schedule Action Items, but let’s dive in deeper into how this feature can improve your workflows!

          # **Understand your team’s agenda at a glance**

          - **View Action Items:** On your Team Planner, you can see a clear agenda of what's planned for today and tomorrow. This immediate insight helps in aligning your tasks with the team's priorities and ensures everyone is on the same page.

          - **Review completed tasks:** Easily track completed Action Items from today, yesterday, and any previous days. This retrospective view not only offers a sense of accomplishment but also aids in evaluating team productivity and planning future tasks more effectively.

          # **Optimize your team’s efficiency**

          - **Enhanced visibility and coordination:** By having a comprehensive overview of the team's planned and completed Action Items, you can better coordinate efforts, avoid overlaps, and identify areas needing more resources.

          - **Streamlined communication:** The Team Planner reduces the need for constant check-ins and meetings, as team members can directly see each other’s planned and completed tasks, fostering a more efficient workflow.


          ***Team Planner - Agenda view***

          ***Team Planner - Calendar view***
          ![](image://file?file=${docImage4}&width=1440)

          As you continue to use Action Items in Huly, you’ll discover how they seamlessly integrate into both your personal and team planning processes, elevating the way you manage and execute tasks. The Team Planner is just one of the many ways Huly empowers you and your team to stay organized, synchronized, and productive.
