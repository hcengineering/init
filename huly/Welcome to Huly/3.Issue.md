**_Creating a new issue (optional alternative)_**

Instead of assigning an existing issue to yourself, you can also create a new issue!

1. Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the top of the side panel (or press `C` from any view).
2. Enter some information about your issue, such as a title and description.
3. Set the `Assignee` to **yourself**. 
4. Set the `Status` to **Todo**. ❗_This is important for the next step!_
