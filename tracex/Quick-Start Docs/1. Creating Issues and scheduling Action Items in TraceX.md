title: Creating Issues and scheduling Action Items in TraceX
---

You’ll complete **3 tasks** to learn about the essential features of the TraceX platform:

1. Create your first **Project** 📌
2. Create your first **Issue** 📝)
3. Schedule your first **Action Item** 📆

### Task 1 - Create your first project

Let’s create your first project in TraceX!

⚠️ **Tip:** To follow this guide and complete the steps at the same time, we recommend opening **two browser windows** — one for this guide and one for the `Controlled Documents` module.

There are two ways to create a project:

* Hover over **YOUR PROJECTS** and click the `+` icon that appears, *or*
* Click the dropdown menu next to the `+ New issue` button and select `Create project`. 

A **title** and **default assignee** are required. You can also add a **description**, choose a custom **identifier** and select an **icon** for your project. 

Next, click `Create`!

🎉 Congratulations! You’ve completed Task 1 ✅

### Task 2 - Create your first issue

An **issue** represents a specific task that needs to be completed. Projects can be broken down into issues and sub-issues.

Let’s create your first issue in TraceX!

Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the top of the side panel (or simply press `C` from any view!). This will open a dialog where you can enter some initial settings for your issue. 

> **Tip:** By default, the issue will be associated with the project you’re currently viewing. You can change this to the project you just created by selecting it from the dropdown in the top left corner.

Next, enter some information about your issue: 

* Provide a **title** and **description**. 
* Choose some settings, such as **priority**, **labels**, **estimation** and **due date**. 
* The **assignee** will be the default assignee you selected for your project.
* ❗ Ensure that the **status** is set to “Todo” — *this is important for the next step!*

When you’re ready, click `Create issue`!

### Next: Task 3 - Schedule your first Action Item

In this step, you’ll learn how TraceX has *automatically* created an Action Item for this issue, which you’ll schedule in your personal Planner. Click the button below to continue!

An **Action Item** is a task to be completed by a specific team member. 

> *But wait … didn’t we just create an **issue** assigned to a team member?* What’s the difference? 

At a glance:

* **Issue** - work that needs to be completed 
* **Action Item** - an individual’s responsibility to complete that work

When an issue is created with the status of “Todo” and assigned to a team member, that team member receives a corresponding Action Item in their personal Planner.

Let’s see how the issue status is *automatically updated* based on an individual team member’s progress towards their Action Item. Let’s go!

---

Remember that issue you just created in the previous step? Because you set the issue status to “Todo” and assigned it to yourself, you’ve received a corresponding Action Item for that issue.

Head over to your Planner by clicking the calendar icon in the left sidebar. Here, you’ll see an Action Item for the issue you just created!

There are 2 ways to schedule an Action Item:

* Click and drag the Action Item to your calendar on the right, *or*
* Click on the Action Item to open it in the right side panel. Click `Add Slot` to create a time slot representing when you plan to do the work. From there, you can adjust the day and time and add more slots if needed.

Notice that when you schedule an Action Item, it moves from “Unplanned” to “Scheduled” on your list.

Now, navigate back to the Tracker by clicking the checkbox icon in the left side panel. Notice that the status of your issue *automatically updated* to “In Progress”! That’s because you scheduled your Action Item, indicating your commitment to completing the work.

If you’d like, go ahead back to your Planner and check off your Action Item by clicking the round checkbox that appears when you hover over it. You’ll see that the issue status automatically updates to “Done”.
