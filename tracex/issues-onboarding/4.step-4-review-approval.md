TraceX includes electronic signatures that comply with **all regulatory requirements**, including **21 CFR Part 11 (FDA)**. These signatures ensure every step of the review and approval process is fully traceable and audit-ready.

Signatures are timestamped and will appear in the final exported PDF in the correct order:

**Author → Reviewer → Approver**

This guarantees traceability and regulatory compliance.

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- All comments must be resolved before approval. If not, the **“Send for approval”** button will be disabled.
- If the document was edited by the author after the first review completion, it must be reviewed again before approval.
- Approvers can then sign, approve, or reject the document.
