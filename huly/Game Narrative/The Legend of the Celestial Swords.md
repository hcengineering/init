Long before the kingdoms of Eldoria rose, the world was shaped by the power of the Celestial Swords‚Äîfive divine blades forged by the gods themselves. ‚öîÔ∏è Each sword held dominion over an elemental force, granting unimaginable power to its wielder. But with power came ambition, and war soon followed. The swords were lost to time, their locations hidden in myth, waiting for those deemed worthy to reclaim them.

### üåå Origin

According to ancient scriptures, the gods gifted these swords to five chosen warriors to defend the realm from the Primordial Chaos. For centuries, balance was maintained, but greed and betrayal led to the great Sundering, a war that shattered the harmony between mortals and the divine. To prevent further bloodshed, the swords were scattered across Eldoria, each bound by powerful enchantments that only the pure of heart‚Äîor the truly desperate‚Äîcould break.

### ‚öîÔ∏è The Five Celestial Swords

* **Solbrand - Sword of Light**
Wielded by heroes, this blade shines with the brilliance of the sun, banishing darkness and evil.

* **Umbravir - Blade of Shadows**
A cursed weapon that can slip through reality, striking enemies before they can react.

* **Galeclaw - Edge of the Tempest**
A sword imbued with the wind‚Äôs fury, allowing its wielder to move with impossible speed.

* **Tidefang - Abyssal Fang**
A blade of ever-flowing water, capable of cutting through the strongest armor like a river carving stone.

* **Pyrestorm - Infernal Wrath**
A weapon of searing fire, said to consume its bearer if they lack the strength to control it.

### ‚ú® Prophecy of their Return

Legends foretell that when Eldoria faces its darkest hour, the Celestial Swords shall reawaken. ‚ú® Only one with the courage to seek them and the wisdom to wield their power will be able to unite the blades and restore balance to the world. But beware‚Äîthose who covet the swords for themselves risk falling to the same corruption that once doomed the past rulers of Eldoria.
