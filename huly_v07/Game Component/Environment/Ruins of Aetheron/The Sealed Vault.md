The **Sealed Vault** is an ancient, heavily guarded structure that holds secrets, treasures, and relics of unimaginable power. For centuries, it has remained locked, with only the Ancient Key being capable of unlocking its doors. Inside the vault, the Hero will face a series of trials, puzzles, and enemies, all designed to protect the sacred knowledge within. The vault’s contents are critical to understanding the overarching mystery, and gaining access is key to completing the Hero’s quest.
