Map out the overarching structure of the game’s narrative by identifying the key story beats that define the player’s journey. These should include major turning points such as the opening hook, inciting incident, rising tension, climax, and resolution. 

Focus on the emotional pacing—how the player should feel at each point in the game—and how the story escalates and evolves. Keep it broad and flexible at this stage, but make sure there’s a clear narrative arc that aligns with the core gameplay loop and player progression. 

This outline will guide the development of dialogue, cutscenes, quests, and world events.
