Develop a rich and compelling backstory for the main character that captures their personal history, core motivations, and emotional arc. Consider where they come from, what pivotal experiences shaped them, and why they’re involved in the events of the game. 

The narrative should hint at both internal and external conflicts and create opportunities for character development over time. Ensure the backstory connects meaningfully with the world’s lore and supports the themes of the game. This will serve as a foundation for dialogue, in-game decisions, and how players emotionally connect with the character.
